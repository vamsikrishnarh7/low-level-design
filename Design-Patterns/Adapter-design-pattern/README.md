# Adapter Design Pattern  
**Definition**  
Adapter converts the interface of a class into another interface that client expects.  
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interface  

**Real-world examples**  
1. Third party library integration
2. Modern application interacting with legacy code
